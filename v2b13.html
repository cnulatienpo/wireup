        <p>
          Somewhere along the way, the questions changed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Early on, everything revolved around names.
          What is this node called. What menu is it in.
          Which operator am I supposed to know.
        </p>

        <p>
          Those questions fade once the system starts behaving as a whole.
        </p>

        <p>
          Right now, you are no longer assembling features.
          You are maintaining conditions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Motion exists because something insists.
          Structure exists because something remembers.
          Images exist because something is watching.
          Decisions exist because something is allowed through.
          Stability exists because pressure is shaped.
        </p>

        <p>
          None of those ideas belong to software.
        </p>

        <p>
          They belong to systems.
        </p>

        <div class="do">
          <p>
            Look at your network one last time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do not zoom in.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          You are not meant to read it line by line.
        </p>

        <p>
          You recognize it the way you recognize a room you know well.
          You know where things tend to live.
          You know which areas are sensitive.
          You know where change will echo.
        </p>

        <p>
          That recognition did not come from memorization.
          It came from repeated cause and effect.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is why the system resists step-by-step mastery.
          Steps imply sequence.
          What you built responds to relationship.
        </p>

        <p>
          When something breaks now, you do not panic.
          You isolate pressure.
          You follow influence.
          You adjust responsibility.
        </p>

        <p>
          That is not using software.
          That is operating a rig.
        </p>

        <p>
          Software usually asks you what you want to make.
          This asks you what you are willing to maintain.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you remove one piece, something else will compensate.
          If you add something reckless, the system will tell you immediately.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is why people describe the experience as physical.
          Not because it involves hardware,
          but because it responds like something with mass.
        </p>

        <p>
          You do not finish systems like this.
          You leave them running.
        </p>

        <p>
          At some point, you stop thinking about TouchDesigner at all.
        </p>

        <p>
          You think in signals, pressure, thresholds, and agreements.
        </p>

        <p>
          That is the real transition.
