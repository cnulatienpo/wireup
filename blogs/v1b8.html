        <p>Intention is invisible to the system.</p>

        <p>You can want a network to behave a certain way, but containers only know what arrives at their inputs this frame.</p>

        <p>This creates a gap that feels personal at first.</p>

        <p>Each container responds to the immediate situation touching it and nothing beyond that boundary.</p>

        <p>A node does not know it is part of a larger plan. It knows the type, structure, and timing of the signal it receives.</p>

        <p>Adjusting something downstream to satisfy an upstream wish only hides the disagreement. Containers respond to actual inputs, not intention.</p>

        <p>Global intention lives in your head. Local truth lives in the wires.</p>

        <p>When a result surprises you, it is honoring the exact conditions presented to it.</p>

        <p>Representation is human interpretation. Containers only care whether a value changes, repeats, arrives late, or arrives malformed.</p>

        <p>Debugging improves when you ask what this container sees right now.</p>

        <p>Each part does its job without negotiating meaning. Results emerge from alignment, not interpretation.</p>

        <p>Intention belongs in how responsibilities are arranged, not in what you expect the system to infer.</p>
