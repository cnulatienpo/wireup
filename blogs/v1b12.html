      <p>
        The interface is not decorative.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is diagnostic.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most programs try to reduce what you see to a single surface. A canvas. A timeline. A document. Anything that does not fit that surface is tucked away behind menus so the environment feels calm.
      </p>

      <p>
        This one refuses to compress itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        The network view shows relationships. The parameter pane shows conditions. The viewer shows current output. The timeline shows persistence. Each pane reveals a different layer of truth, and none of them cancel the others.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beginners often stare at the viewer first. It looks authoritative. Bright image, immediate feedback. When something feels wrong, the instinct is to keep watching it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The viewer is only a symptom. It shows what survived the trip through the network. If something upstream is misaligned, the viewer will faithfully display the result of that misalignment.
      </p>

      <p>
        The parameter pane is quieter but more revealing. Numbers that are not changing. Toggles that are stuck. Inputs that are missing. Reading this pane tells you what the container believes right now.
      </p>

      <p>
        The network editor reveals dependency. Which containers rely on which others. Where signals split. Where they combine. When something fails, the shape of that dependency often explains the failure faster than any individual value.
      </p>

      <p>
        Status indicators matter. Flags. Warning colors. Cook times. These are not decoration. They are the system telling you where evaluation is happening and where it is not.
      </p>

      <p>
        Reading the interface means correlating panes. If the viewer looks wrong, check the parameters. If parameters look correct, trace upstream connections. If connections look correct, confirm time is advancing. No single pane tells the whole story.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you stop asking which panel is the “main” one, the interface becomes coherent. It is not fragmented. It is layered.
      </p>

      <p>
        The UI is not trying to simplify the system. It is trying to show you exactly what it is doing from multiple angles at once.
      </p>
