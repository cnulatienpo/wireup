      <p>The interface is not trying to be friendly.</p>
      <p>It is trying to be truthful.</p>

      <p>Most software hides complexity behind a single surface. One window. One canvas. One place where things happen. That approach feels comfortable, but it limits what you see.</p>

      <p>This interface refuses that arrangement.</p>

      <p>Network view shows relationships. Parameter panes show conditions. Viewers show symptoms. Timelines show persistence. None replace the others.</p>

      <p>Viewers look authoritative, but they only show output at a particular moment under particular conditions.</p>

      <p>Parameters expose everything because the system does not know which controls matter to you.</p>

      <p>The network editor is a map of obligation. Each wire represents something that must be honored continuously.</p>

      <p>Rearranging panes does not reduce complexity. It only shifts attention.</p>

      <p>Structural issues show up in the network. Behavioral issues show up in parameters. Perceptual issues show up in viewers. Timing issues can appear across all of them.</p>

      <p>The interface presents multiple partial truths. You correlate them.</p>
