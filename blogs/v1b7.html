        <p>The word “flow” picks up baggage fast.</p>

        <p>People imagine motion as something dramatic. Lines pulsing. Values surging. When that spectacle does not appear, the assumption follows that nothing is happening.</p>

        <p>Flow is simpler than that.</p>

        <p>Something enters a container. The container evaluates it. Something leaves, or nothing does. That evaluation repeats every frame.</p>

        <p>A steady signal is still flowing. Each frame asks the same question and receives the same answer.</p>

        <p>Wiring allows flow. A connection is permission, not pressure. Until something upstream changes, downstream containers have nothing to respond to.</p>

        <p>Networks can look busy but behave inert. Boxes everywhere. Wires crossing. No demand.</p>

        <p>Containers do not interpret intention. They respond to type and structure.</p>

        <p>Flow can originate anywhere a value changes over time. A timer. A sensor. A file updating.</p>

        <p>One signal can travel multiple paths at once. There is no notion of depletion.</p>

        <p>When flow stops, outputs flatten. The fix involves tracing change backward to its origin.</p>

        <p>Flow is the condition that allows anything downstream to matter.</p>
