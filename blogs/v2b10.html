<p>
Failure in TouchDesigner is rarely random.
</p>

<p>
Most glitches, frozen outputs, or black viewers are symptoms of specific structural problems.
</p>

<p>
Common failure modes include missing inputs, incorrect data types, values stuck at zero, and feedback loops without damping.
</p>

<p>
A black output usually means no signal is arriving or opacity is set to zero.
</p>

<p>
A node showing an error flag typically indicates a missing dependency or incompatible input.
</p>

<p>
If something flickers or explodes, amplification is likely happening in a loop.
</p>

<p>
When a parameter refuses to update, check whether it is being overridden by an export or expression.
</p>

<p>
If performance drops unexpectedly, examine resolution, feedback accumulation, or unnecessary conversions.
</p>

<p>
Debugging begins upstream.
</p>

<p>
Trace the signal backward from the symptom.
</p>

<p>
Open viewers on intermediate nodes.
</p>

<p>
Confirm where the behavior changes.
</p>

<p>
Most real problems are one or two nodes earlier than expected.
</p>

<p>
Treat every visible glitch as a clue rather than a catastrophe.
</p>

<p>
Systems reveal their structure most clearly when they break.
</p>

<p>
Failure modes are maps of the network’s assumptions.
</p>

<p>
Learn the patterns once, and future debugging becomes recognition rather than guesswork.
