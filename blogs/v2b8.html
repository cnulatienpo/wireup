<p>
More nodes feel like progress.
</p>

<p>
When something does not work, the instinct is to add another operator. Another transform. Another conversion. Another layer of logic.
</p>

<p>
Most of the time, the issue is not missing functionality.
</p>

<p>
It is misaligned responsibility.
</p>

<p>
Every additional node introduces another dependency. More evaluation. More opportunity for unexpected state.
</p>

<p>
Switch nodes reveal this clearly.
</p>

<p>
A Switch does not modify data. It chooses which existing data is allowed through.
</p>

<p>
Nothing new is created. No heavy processing is introduced.
</p>

<p>
Meaning changes because selection changes.
</p>

<p>
Instead of stacking more transformations, consider whether existing outputs simply need governance.
</p>

<p>
Often the correct move is subtraction.
</p>

<p>
Remove redundant transforms. Remove duplicate conversions. Remove nodes that compensate for earlier structural mistakes.
</p>

<p>
Networks become easier to read when each node has one responsibility.
</p>

<p>
If a node is performing two conceptual tasks, the structure is unclear.
</p>

<p>
Fewer operators reduce ambiguity.
</p>

<p>
Performance improves not because the system is fragile, but because evaluation paths are shorter.
</p>

<p>
Clarity emerges from intention, not accumulation.
</p>

<p>
Before adding a node, ask what dependency truly needs adjustment.
</p>

<p>
Most complex systems fail from excess, not absence.
</p>
