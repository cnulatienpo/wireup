<p>
A minimal network has only what is necessary to produce behavior.
</p>

<p>
For beginners, complexity hides understanding. Every additional operator creates another dependency to reason about.
</p>

<p>
A simple setup reveals cause and effect clearly.
</p>

<p>
A source produces data. A transform modifies it. An output displays it.
</p>

<p>
That chain is enough to learn most core ideas.
</p>

<p>
When learning, avoid stacking layers of modulation, conversion, and switching too early.
</p>

<p>
Three to six nodes are often sufficient to understand interaction.
</p>

<p>
Minimal does not mean limited.
</p>

<p>
It means intentional.
</p>

<p>
If something breaks, fewer nodes make tracing upstream faster.
</p>

<p>
If something behaves strangely, fewer dependencies make debugging easier.
</p>

<p>
Minimal networks teach structure instead of decoration.
</p>

<p>
Once structure is understood, expansion becomes deliberate rather than reactive.
</p>

<p>
Large systems are built from small understandable pieces.
</p>

<p>
A beginner who masters small patches progresses faster than one who builds sprawling networks without clarity.
</p>

<p>
Start small. Confirm behavior. Expand carefully.
</p>

<p>
Growth should follow comprehension, not frustration.
