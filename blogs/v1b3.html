        <p>This guide explains TouchDesigner signal flow explained for beginners in plain language. It focuses on practical decisions you can make while building and debugging TouchDesigner networks.</p>
        <!-- SEO-INTRO-END -->

        <p>
          Most programs teach you “object thinking” (toy thinking).
        </p>

        <p>
          A toy is a thing you can point at.
          A toy sits still until you pick it up.
          A file, a layer, a picture, a shape — toy thinking says: “That’s my thing.”
        </p>

        <p>
          TouchDesigner is “operator thinking” (machine thinking).
        </p>

        <p>
          An operator (OP) is a little machine.
          You do not “own” a machine the same way you own a toy.
          You set up a machine, you feed it, and it keeps working.
        </p>

        <p>
          A node is not “the picture.”
          A node is a box that makes or changes pictures.
          The picture is more like water running through a pipe.
        </p>

        <p>
          Signal (moving stuff) is what travels through the pipes.
          A signal can be an image (moving pixels),
          a number (a knob value),
          sound (a wiggly line),
          text (words in a table),
          or geometry (a shape description).
        </p>

        <p>
          Signal flow (pipe flow) is just “what feeds what.”
          This box feeds that box.
          That box feeds the next one.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here is the part that feels weird at first:
          time is always moving.
          TouchDesigner updates in frames (flipbook pages).
        </p>

        <p>
          Frame (flipbook page) means:
          the system checks again.
          The machine runs again.
          The pipes keep moving.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is why “nothing happened” is confusing here.
          The machines might still be working.
          They might just be working on something boring.
          Like a faucet running at the same speed.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is also why copying a node can surprise you.
          You copied a machine, not a result.
          Two machines can behave differently if their food (input) is different.
        </p>

        <p>
          Input (what comes in) is the food.
          Output (what goes out) is what the machine makes.
          Parameters (knobs) are the settings.
        </p>

        <p>
          The system cares about dependencies (needs-this-first links).
        </p>

        <p>
          Dependency (needs-this-first) means:
          “I cannot make my output until I get that input.”
          It is like: you cannot make toast until you have bread.
        </p>

        <p>
          So when you delete one node, stuff that looks “unrelated” can change.
          It was related through pipes and needs-this-first links.
          You pulled out a piece of plumbing.
          Water stopped reaching rooms you forgot were connected.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is the shift:
          stop asking “Where is the thing?”
          start asking “What is feeding what?”
        </p>

        <p>
          Once you see flow, you can debug like this:
          find where the water looks wrong,
          then walk upstream (backward) until it stops being wrong.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nothing here is an object (a toy).
          Everything here is a running setup (machines + pipes + knobs).
        </p>

        <!-- SEO-QUESTIONS-START -->
        <h2>What is signal flow in TouchDesigner?</h2>
        <p>
          Signal flow (pipe flow) is the path your signal (moving stuff) takes through operators (machines).
          If you can point to what feeds what, you can understand most networks.
        </p>

        <h2>Why is my network not passing data forward?</h2>
        <p>
          Usually one of these is true:
          the wire is missing (no pipe),
          the source is off (no water),
          or something upstream is blocked (a needs-this-first link is failing).
        </p>

        <h2>How do I trace flow through connected operators?</h2>
        <p>
          Start at the end (the result you can see).
          Move one box left at a time.
          Check each viewer (peephole) until you find the first place it looks wrong.
          That first wrong place is usually the real problem.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>is every node in touchdesigner an object</h3>
            <p>
              No. A node is an operator (a little machine), not an object (a toy).
              It keeps working as frames (flipbook pages) move forward, based on what you feed it.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>why does deleting one node change unrelated results</h3>
            <p>
              Because “unrelated” often means “connected by pipes you forgot.”
              Deleting a node removes a dependency (needs-this-first link).
              Stuff downstream was relying on it, so it changes immediately.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>touchdesigner oop vs node based thinking</h3>
            <p>
              OOP is “objects calling each other.”
              TouchDesigner is “signals flowing through operators.”
              Think plumbing and machines, not ownership and class trees.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>how to think about identity in touchdesigner operators</h3>
            <p>
              Identity is the job.
              Input (food) comes in, knobs (parameters) set the behavior, output comes out.
              The operator is “what it does,” not “what it is called.”
