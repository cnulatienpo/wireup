        <p><strong>This guide explains why TouchDesigner stops feeling like software and starts behaving like a system. It focuses on how signal flow, pressure, feedback, and structure change the way you think about building and debugging networks.</strong></p>

        <p>
          Somewhere along the way, the questions change.
        </p>

        <p>
          Early on, everything revolves around names.
          What is this node called. What menu is it in.
          Which operator am I supposed to know.
        </p>

        <p>
          Those questions fade once the system begins behaving as a whole.
        </p>

        <p>
          You are no longer assembling features.
          You are maintaining conditions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Motion exists because something insists.
          Structure exists because something remembers.
          Images exist because something is watching.
          Decisions exist because something is allowed through.
          Stability exists because pressure is shaped.
        </p>

        <p>
          None of those ideas belong strictly to software.
          They belong to systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          At this stage, memorizing operators becomes irrelevant.
          What matters is recognizing roles.
        </p>

        <p>
          When something breaks, you isolate pressure.
          You follow influence.
          You adjust responsibility.
        </p>

        <p>
          That shift is the moment it stops feeling like an application
          and starts feeling like operating a rig.
        </p>

        <p>
          Software usually asks what you want to make.
          Systems ask what you are willing to maintain.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you remove one piece, something else compensates.
          If you add something reckless, instability appears immediately.
        </p>

        <p>
          The network responds like something with mass.
          It carries inertia. It carries tension.
        </p>

        <p>
          You do not finish systems like this.
          You leave them running.
        </p>

        <p>
          At some point, you stop thinking about TouchDesigner.
          You think in signals, thresholds, influence, and agreements.

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Why does TouchDesigner feel different from traditional software?</h3>
          <p>Because it is built around signal relationships instead of step-by-step commands. Behavior emerges from connections rather than menu-driven sequences.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>When does TouchDesigner stop feeling confusing?</h3>
          <p>Usually when you stop memorizing operator names and start recognizing structural roles like source, transform, translation, feedback, and control.</p>
