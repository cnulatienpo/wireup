        <p>This guide explains GPU space vs data space in TouchDesigner in plain language. It focuses on practical decisions you can make while building and debugging TouchDesigner networks.</p>
        <!-- SEO-INTRO-END -->
<p>
TouchDesigner operates in two primary territories: GPU space and CPU data space.
</p>

<p>
GPU space handles images, textures, geometry, and rendering. CPU data space handles tables, scripts, and structured values.
</p>

<p>
TOPs and most 3D rendering operations occur on the GPU. DATs and many scripting operations occur on the CPU.
</p>

<p>
These spaces behave differently.
</p>

<p>
GPU processing is massively parallel and optimized for pixels and vertices. CPU processing is sequential and optimized for logic and structured data.
</p>

<p>
When you move data from one space to another, translation happens. That translation costs time.
</p>

<p>
For example, converting a TOP to CHOP values or exporting a texture into a DAT table forces GPU data into CPU memory.
</p>

<p>
Frequent crossing between GPU and CPU can reduce performance significantly.
</p>

<p>
The question is not which space is better. The question is which space matches the task.
</p>

<p>
Image processing, feedback loops, compositing, and rendering belong on the GPU.
</p>

<p>
String manipulation, structured logic, file operations, and table lookups belong on the CPU.
</p>

<p>
If something feels unexpectedly slow, examine where it is being processed.
</p>

<p>
Efficiency often comes from minimizing unnecessary border crossings.
</p>

<p>
Understanding this separation allows you to design networks that remain responsive even as complexity increases.
