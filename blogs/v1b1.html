        <h1>What this software is doing while you’re staring at it</h1>
        <p>This guide explains what is TouchDesigner for complete beginners in plain language. It focuses on practical decisions you can make while building and debugging TouchDesigner networks.</p>
      </header>

      <article>
        <p>The screen is not waiting for you.</p>

        <p>That detail explains the strange unease people feel when this software opens and nothing acknowledges their presence. No blinking cursor asking for direction. No empty canvas suggesting intention. No pause while you decide what kind of person you plan to be today. Activity is already underway, even if you cannot name it yet.</p>

        <p>This software runs the way a room runs. Power hums through it. Time advances. State is maintained. Opening a file does not initiate motion; it places you inside a system that never stopped. What looks like stillness is a loop doing its job over and over without commentary.</p>

        <p>Most programs behave transactionally. You act, they respond. You stop, they freeze politely. This one behaves more like a rig left powered overnight. Values refresh. Conditions are checked. Signals circulate through agreements that were made long before you arrived.</p>

        <p>Nothing happening feels uncomfortable here because nothing happening does not mean rest. It means repetition. A value holding steady across frames is still being reaffirmed frame after frame. Stability is not the absence of change; it is a condition that keeps getting approved.</p>

        <p>Time is not something you enable later. You inherit it the moment the project opens. Every number exists inside before and after, even when it never moves. The system does not ask whether you intend to animate. It assumes time applies regardless.</p>

        <p>Screenshots cause trouble for this reason. A paused network looks like a diagram, but it behaves more like surveillance footage. Resume it and the activity continues without consulting your expectations. Nothing inside the network knows you are observing it. Nothing adjusts itself for explanation.</p>

        <p>Questions about where execution begins come from software that behaves like a sentence. Start here. End there. This environment behaves more like weather. Pressure builds. Patterns repeat. Events overlap. Asking where it starts misunderstands the shape of the thing.</p>

        <p>What runs is not the network as a story. What runs is the agreement that each container keeps checking its inputs and updating its outputs as long as time advances. That agreement is not optional. Closing the file is the only way to interrupt it.</p>

        <p>This explains the familiar urge to add more pieces when nothing responds. That impulse makes sense in software that waits. Here it only feeds the system more material to disregard. If nothing reacts, it is not asleep. It is active and unconvinced.</p>

        <p>Attention shifts once this is understood. Effort moves away from trying to wake things up and toward noticing what they are already doing. Patterns become audible. Dropouts become obvious. The system communicates through behavior rather than messages.</p>

        <p>This software does not announce that it is running. It assumes that part is understood.</p>

        <h3>why does touchdesigner keep running when i am not clicking anything</h3>
        <p>TouchDesigner cooks continuously because operators evaluate on frame updates, not only on user actions. Even a stable value is being re-checked over time.</p>

        <h3>where does execution start in touchdesigner</h3>
        <p>There is rarely a single start line in a networked project. Evaluation emerges from dependencies, time, and active viewers.</p>

        <h3>why does nothing happen but cpu is still active in touchdesigner</h3>
        <p>A quiet output does not mean the network is idle. Operators can keep cooking to maintain state and confirm inputs every frame.</p>

        <h3>is touchdesigner event based or real time</h3>
        <p>It is primarily real-time and frame-driven, with events layered on top.</p>
