        <!-- SEO-INTRO-START -->
        <p>This guide explains what is TouchDesigner for complete beginners in plain language. It focuses on practical decisions you can make while building and debugging TouchDesigner networks.</p>
        <!-- SEO-INTRO-END -->

        <p>The screen is not waiting for you.</p>

        <p>
          That detail explains the strange unease people feel when this software opens and nothing acknowledges their presence.
          No blinking cursor asking for direction. No empty canvas suggesting intention.
          Activity is already underway, even if you cannot name it yet.
        </p>

        <p>
          TouchDesigner runs like a powered rig. Time advances. Things keep checking their relationships.
          Opening a file does not “begin” the project. It drops you into something that is already alive.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most programs are transactional: you act, they respond, you stop, they freeze politely.
          This one keeps its posture even when you are hands-off.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Nothing happening” feels uncomfortable here because “nothing happening” usually means “holding steady.”
          Holding steady still requires constant checking. The system keeps reaffirming what depends on what.
        </p>

        <p>
          Screenshots cause confusion for the same reason. A frozen view looks like a diagram, but the project behaves like a running setup.
          Resume it and it continues without caring what you expected.
        </p>

        <p>
          Questions like “where does it start?” come from software that behaves like a sentence: first word, last word.
          This behaves more like a room with multiple lights and switches. Different parts become active when something asks for them.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you understand that, the urge to “add more stuff until it wakes up” weakens.
          If nothing reacts, the project is usually not asleep. It is running and ignoring whatever is irrelevant.
        </p>

        <p>
          The skill is noticing what is already moving, what is holding, and what is being asked for right now.
          That is where debugging starts in this world.
        </p>

        <!-- SEO-QUESTIONS-START -->
        <h2>What is TouchDesigner actually used for?</h2>
        <p>
          TouchDesigner is used to build real-time systems: visuals that react to music, interactive installations,
          live show graphics, projection mapping, camera-based effects, sensor-driven pieces, and control rigs for lighting or media servers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The common thread is not “making a picture.” The common thread is “keeping a behavior running” while inputs change:
          audio, time, controllers, cameras, data feeds, or human interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have ever wanted a thing to respond while it is happening, not after you export it, this is the lane.
        </p>

        <h2>Is TouchDesigner hard for beginners to learn?</h2>
        <p>
          The hard part is not a hidden trick. The hard part is the mental switch:
          you stop thinking “I click a tool, then I draw.”
          You start thinking “signals flow, parts influence other parts, the whole keeps running.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Beginners usually get stuck for three reasons:
        </p>
        <p>
          One: they expect the screen to wait.
          Two: they expect one obvious “start point.”
          Three: they treat every new box as a feature instead of a role.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learning speeds up when you build tiny chains on purpose and watch what changes when you change one thing.
        </p>

        <h2>Do I need to code to use TouchDesigner?</h2>
        <p>
          No. You can get very far by wiring parts together and linking controls to behaviors.
          Many TouchDesigner projects are built entirely without writing code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Code becomes useful when you want rules, automation, file handling, custom tools, or bigger coordination.
          It is optional at the start. It becomes a power-up later.
        </p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>why does touchdesigner keep running when i am not clicking anything</h3>
            <p>
              TouchDesigner is designed for live systems. It keeps updating time and checking how things are connected,
              even if you do nothing. A still picture can still be part of a running setup.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>where does execution start in touchdesigner</h3>
            <p>
              There usually is not one start point. Parts run because something is using them right now
              (a viewer, a recorder, an output, or another part downstream). The useful question is:
              “What am I asking the project to show or send right now?”
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>why does nothing happen but cpu is still active in touchdesigner</h3>
            <p>
              “Nothing happening” often means “holding steady.” The project can still be updating timing,
              checking inputs, and maintaining behavior. CPU activity often means the project is staying ready.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>is touchdesigner event based or real time</h3>
            <p>
              It is mainly real-time: it keeps moving forward moment by moment.
              Button presses and keyboard actions can trigger changes too, but the default mode is continuous motion.
