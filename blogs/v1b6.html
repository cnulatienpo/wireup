        <p>Time does not announce itself here.</p>

        <p>There is no switch for it, no permission slip, no moment where you decide to involve it. The system advances whether you acknowledge it or not. Frames pass. Evaluation repeats.</p>

        <p>A value that stays the same is still being checked. A signal that looks flat is still being reaffirmed. The absence of visible motion does not mean absence of activity.</p>

        <p>In many tools, time shows up only when you ask for animation. Here, time is part of the ground rules. It applies to everything equally, including things that appear static.</p>

        <p>A number is not a choice you made once. It is a condition enforced again and again. Every frame agrees to it unless something upstream forces a disagreement.</p>

        <p>Stopping change does not stop time. It only stops variation. The system continues to evaluate the same relationships repeatedly.</p>

        <p>People look for where time begins. What exists instead is a continuous present that keeps renewing itself.</p>

        <p>A loop is not a delay waiting to happen. It is influence returning with every frame. The system treats each cycle as current state, not memory.</p>

        <p>Timing problems rarely show up as errors. They appear as drift, accumulation, or saturation because time keeps advancing.</p>

        <p>Control based on single moments struggles here. Conditions based on duration or accumulation align better with how evaluation works.</p>

        <p>Time is not layered on top of the work. It is the medium everything passes through, whether it moves or not.</p>
