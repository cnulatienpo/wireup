        <p>
          Time does not announce itself here.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is no switch for it, no permission slip, no moment where you decide to involve it. The system advances whether you acknowledge it or not. Frames pass. Evaluation repeats. The clock does not wait for agreement.
        </p>

        <p>
          A value that stays the same is still being checked. A signal that looks flat is still being reaffirmed. The absence of visible motion does not mean absence of activity. It means the same decision keeps being made.
        </p>

        <p>
          This breaks a familiar assumption. In many tools, time shows up only when you ask for animation or playback. Here, time is part of the ground rules. It applies to everything equally, including things that appear static.
        </p>

        <p>
          That is why a single number can feel heavier than expected. It is not a choice you made once. It is a condition enforced again and again. Every frame agrees to it unless something upstream forces a disagreement.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is also why pauses feel strange. Stopping change does not stop time. It only stops variation. The system continues to evaluate the same relationships over and over, confirming that nothing new has been introduced.
        </p>

        <p>
          People often look for the moment where time begins. They expect a playhead, a start marker, a beginning they can point to. What exists instead is a continuous present that keeps renewing itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          Feedback behaves differently once this is understood. A loop is not a delay waiting to happen. It is influence returning with every frame. The system does not remember the previous cycle as history. It treats it as the current state being fed back into itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          This explains why timing problems rarely announce themselves as errors. They show up as drift, accumulation, or saturation. Effects appear late, early, or never, not because something broke, but because time kept doing its job while expectations lagged behind.
        </p>

        <p>
          Control based on single moments struggles here. Toggles feel blunt. Triggers feel fragile. Conditions based on duration, accumulation, or change over time fit better, because they speak the same language as the system.
        </p>

        <p>
          Time is not a feature layered on top of the work. It is the medium everything passes through, whether it moves or not.
