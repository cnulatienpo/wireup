        <p>There is no hidden script behind the scenes.</p>

        <p>What you see wired together is not a representation of the program. It is the program.</p>

        <p>Structure and behavior live in the same place.</p>

        <p>Each connection is a relationship that must be honored continuously. Remove it and behavior changes immediately.</p>

        <p>Behavior emerges from arrangement, not from a single important node.</p>

        <p>Small structural changes can have larger effects than dramatic parameter tweaks.</p>

        <p>Refactoring feels physical because responsibilities shift while everything keeps running.</p>

        <p>The network is not documentation describing something else. It exists to be evaluated.</p>

        <p>Problems usually live in how influence travels across the structure, not inside one parameter.</p>

        <p>Effort shifts from searching for the right setting to arranging flow correctly.</p>

        <p>The program is spelled out in wires, dependencies, and repetition across frames.</p>
