        <p>
          At this point, the system is crowded.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is motion, space, images, sound, memory, switching, feedback, and control.
          Nothing here is isolated anymore. Every part is aware that other parts exist,
          even if they are not directly connected.
        </p>

        <p>
          This page is not about adding something new.
          It is about noticing what has already formed.
        </p>

        <div class="do">
          <p>
            Look at your network without touching anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            Zoom out until you can see most of it at once.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          The shape matters.
        </p>

        <p>
          Clusters reveal purpose. Long chains reveal dependency.
          Tight loops reveal sensitivity. Wide fans reveal choice.
        </p>

        <p>
          None of this was planned.
          It emerged from necessity.
        </p>

        <div class="do">
          <p>
            Pick one signal that moves through multiple parts of the system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Follow it with your eyes from start to finish.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          That signal has a life.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is born somewhere. It is shaped. It is translated.
          It is consulted. It is possibly allowed through.
          It may even be asked to explain itself to itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          No single operator owns that behavior.
        </p>

        <div class="do">
          <p>
            Temporarily disconnect one wire in the middle of that path.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          The system adapts instantly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Something goes quiet. Something freezes.
          Something downstream becomes irrelevant.
        </p>

        <p>
          Reconnect the wire.
        </p>

        <p>
          The behavior returns without ceremony.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is the clearest proof that the system is not a stack of effects.
          It is a set of agreements.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each operator agrees to do one thing if certain conditions are met.
          The network exists to meet those conditions repeatedly.
        </p>

        <div class="do">
          <p>
            Move one group of nodes farther away from the others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do not change the wiring.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          Nothing changes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meaning does not live in proximity.
          It lives in connection.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is the moment where memorization stops helping.
        </p>

        <p>
          You no longer need to recall what each operator is called.
          You recognize what role it is playing.
        </p>

        <p>
          When something feels missing, you do not search menus.
          You ask what role is absent.
        </p>

        <p>
          When something feels excessive, you do not delete randomly.
          You ask which agreement is redundant.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is fluency.
        </p>

        <p>
          The network is no longer a puzzle to solve.
          It is a place you can walk around in without getting lost.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nothing here is finished.
          It does not need to be.
        </p>

        <p>
          The system is running.
          That is the only requirement it has ever enforced.
