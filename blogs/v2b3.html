<p>
Some operators only care about what arrives this frame.
</p>

<p>
Others remember what happened before.
</p>

<p>
That difference changes everything.
</p>

<p>
A stateless operator evaluates its input and produces an output based only on the current moment. It has no memory. If the same input arrives again, the same output is produced.
</p>

<p>
A stateful operator carries history forward. It accumulates. It delays. It integrates. It compares now to before.
</p>

<p>
Lag, Feedback, Trail, and certain CHOPs are stateful. A Math node performing simple scaling is not.
</p>

<p>
This distinction explains why some nodes behave predictably and others drift, build up, or decay over time.
</p>

<p>
When a node appears to “remember,” it is not thinking. It is storing previous values and using them in current evaluation.
</p>

<p>
Statefulness introduces accumulation. Accumulation introduces instability if not controlled.
</p>

<p>
That is why feedback networks can spiral, freeze, or saturate. The system is honoring past values repeatedly.
</p>

<p>
Resetting a stateful system requires interrupting its memory. That might mean toggling a Reset parameter, clearing a buffer, or briefly breaking a feedback connection.
</p>

<p>
Stateless systems are easier to reason about because they do not depend on history. Stateful systems are powerful because they create continuity.
</p>

<p>
Choosing between them is not about difficulty. It is about whether your design depends on persistence.
