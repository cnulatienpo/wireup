<p>
Every signal has a direction.
</p>

<p>
Upstream refers to anything feeding into a node. Downstream refers to anything receiving output from it.
</p>

<p>
Most debugging mistakes happen because attention stays downstream.
</p>

<p>
When something looks wrong on screen, the instinct is to tweak the final node. Adjust brightness. Change scale. Modify color. That treats symptoms instead of causes.
</p>

<p>
Downstream nodes only react to what they are given.
</p>

<p>
If the output looks wrong, move upstream.
</p>

<p>
Follow the wire backward until you reach the first place where the value changes unexpectedly.
</p>

<p>
Generators sit furthest upstream. Transformers sit between source and result. Renderers and outputs sit furthest downstream.
</p>

<p>
Upstream thinking asks: where does this value originate?
</p>

<p>
Downstream thinking asks: how does this value appear?
</p>

<p>
Both are necessary. Only one solves structural problems.
</p>

<p>
If a network feels unstable, trace the signal to its earliest generator.
</p>

<p>
If a network feels visually incorrect but structurally sound, adjust downstream.
</p>

<p>
The habit of tracing backward saves time.
</p>

<p>
Wires tell a story. Read them from right to left when something fails.
</p>

<p>
Outputs never invent problems. They reveal them.
</p>
