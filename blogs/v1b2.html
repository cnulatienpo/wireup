        <h1>Why this isn’t a normal Photoshop or Windows-style program</h1>
      </header>

      <article>
        <p>
          Most software gives you objects (things that sit there).
        </p>

        <p>
          TouchDesigner gives you operators (little machines that keep working).
        </p>

        <p>
          An object is like a toy on the floor.
          It stays there until you pick it up and move it.
        </p>

        <p>
          An operator (OP) is like a tiny robot.
          You put it down and it starts doing its job right away.
        </p>

        <p>
          In a Photoshop-style program, you edit a picture (a still thing).
          You click, you drag, you paint, you stop.
          The picture stays how you left it.
        </p>

        <p>
          In TouchDesigner, you build a network (a bunch of connected boxes).
          The network runs in real time (it keeps going without waiting for you).
        </p>

        <p>
          Here is the key word: frame (one picture in a fast flipbook).
          TouchDesigner updates again and again, one frame after another.
        </p>

        <p>
          That means an operator runs every frame (every flipbook page).
          Even if you are doing nothing.
          Even if you are staring.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is why it feels “not normal.”
          You are not editing a frozen thing.
          You are tuning a living setup.
        </p>

        <p>
          A Windows-style app often feels like: click → response → done.
          TouchDesigner feels like: wire → behavior → keep watching.
        </p>

        <p>
          The behavior happens because signals (moving information) are flowing.
          A signal can be an image, a number, a sound, a list of text, or geometry.
        </p>

        <p>
          Operators read signals and push new signals forward.
          That is why wires matter more than menus.
        </p>

        <p>
          State (what things are set to right now) matters here.
          State is like “where the knobs are pointing.”
          The system keeps using those knob positions every frame.
        </p>

        <p>
          This also explains why people hunt for layers and artboards.
          Those are “pile” metaphors (stacking paper sheets).
          TouchDesigner is a “plumbing” metaphor (pipes carrying flow).
        </p>

        <p>
          A layer stack says: “what is on top.”
          A network says: “what is feeding what.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Once you accept that, learning gets easier.
          You stop asking “where is the tool.”
          You start asking “what job do I need right now.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Do I need a source (something that makes a signal)?
          Do I need a transform (something that changes the signal)?
          Do I need an output (somewhere the signal ends up)?
        </p>

        <p>
          That is TouchDesigner’s core trick:
          small machines, each doing one job, wired together into behavior.
        </p>

        <!-- SEO-QUESTIONS-START -->
        <h2>Are TouchDesigner operators the same as objects?</h2>
        <p>
          Operators (machines) are not the same as objects (things that sit still).
          Operators keep running every frame (flipbook page) and react to what is wired into them.
        </p>

        <h2>Why does TouchDesigner call things operators?</h2>
        <p>
          Because they operate.
          They take input (what comes in), do a job, and produce output (what goes out),
          again and again, while time keeps moving.
        </p>

        <h2>How should beginners think about OPs?</h2>
        <p>
          Think “tiny job boxes.”
          One box makes something.
          Another box changes it.
          Another box measures it.
          Another box shows it.
          Wires decide who talks to who.

            <h3>why touchdesigner feels different from photoshop</h3>
            <p>
              Photoshop edits a still picture.
              TouchDesigner runs a system.
              One is “make an image and stop.”
              The other is “build behavior that keeps going.”
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>is touchdesigner like windows app development</h3>
            <p>
              A normal app waits for clicks.
              TouchDesigner keeps updating every frame (flipbook page).
              You do not just click buttons.
              You wire machines.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>why cant i find layers and artboards in touchdesigner</h3>
            <p>
              Layers are stacks.
              TouchDesigner is wires.
              You build pictures by sending signals through operators, not by piling sheets.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>what mindset should i use when learning touchdesigner</h3>
            <p>
              Picture a room full of little machines (operators).
              Each machine does one job.
              Wires carry signals between them.
              Watch what changes when you rewire.
