<p>
The official documentation is not hostile. It is precise.
</p>

<p>
What makes it difficult for beginners is not tone. It is compression. The wiki assumes you already understand signal flow, cooking, operator families, and dependency. When those foundations are missing, technical explanations feel abrupt.
</p>

<p>
The documentation describes behavior at the container level. It rarely explains why containers exist in the first place. That gap creates friction.
</p>

<p>
For example, a page may explain how a node cooks when inputs change. If you do not yet understand continuous evaluation, that sentence reads like a special case instead of a default rule.
</p>

<p>
The wiki also assumes comfort with abstraction. Words like parameter, dependency, evaluation, frame, and data type are used precisely. They are not defined repeatedly. The system expects you to already think in terms of relationships instead of objects.
</p>

<p>
Another assumption is that you understand time as infrastructure. Many operator descriptions reference frame updates without restating that everything is frame-driven. Without that mental model, the behavior sounds optional rather than constant.
</p>

<p>
The documentation is written for people who already know what kind of system they are inside. It explains what each operator does. It does not explain why the environment behaves continuously instead of transactionally.
</p>

<p>
Reading the wiki becomes easier once you reinterpret every sentence through a few lenses:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Everything evaluates every frame.</li>
<li>Containers respond only to current inputs.</li>
<li>Dependencies determine behavior, not layout.</li>
<li>No node understands intention.</li>
</ul>

<p>
With those assumptions in place, technical descriptions stop feeling incomplete. They become concise.
</p>

<p>
The wiki is not meant to introduce philosophy. It documents mechanics. Volume 1 covered the philosophy so Volume 2 can move forward without confusion.
