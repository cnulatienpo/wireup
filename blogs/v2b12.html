<p>
Opening a new operator can feel overwhelming.
</p>

<p>
There are parameters, inputs, outputs, and viewers. The goal is not to understand everything immediately.
</p>

<p>
Start by identifying its role.
</p>

<p>
Ask three questions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Does it generate data?</li>
<li>Does it transform data?</li>
<li>Does it expose or route data?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Open the viewer.
</p>

<p>
See what it produces by default. Observe before connecting anything.
</p>

<p>
Next, inspect the parameters.
</p>

<p>
Change one value at a time.
</p>

<p>
Watch how the output reacts.
</p>

<p>
Avoid connecting it to a large network immediately.
</p>

<p>
Test it in isolation.
</p>

<p>
Create a minimal setup where only that operator and a basic source are involved.
</p>

<p>
When testing unfamiliar nodes safely:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Use simple inputs like Constant or Noise</li>
<li>Avoid feedback loops at first</li>
<li>Reduce ranges to small values</li>
<li>Disconnect easily if instability appears</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once behavior is predictable, integrate it into a larger chain.
</p>

<p>
If something unexpected happens, trace upstream.
</p>

<p>
Most confusion comes from misunderstanding input expectations.
</p>

<p>
Learning operator behavior quickly comes from repetition in small controlled contexts.
</p>

<p>
Operators are not mysterious.
</p>

<p>
They perform one function consistently.
</p>

<p>
Your job is to discover what conditions they expect and what form their output takes.
</p>

<p>
Approach each one as a tool with a narrow responsibility.
</p>

<p>
Once you recognize its role, integration becomes straightforward.
