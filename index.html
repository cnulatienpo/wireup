        <ul>

            <a href="/blogs/v1b1.html">What this software is doing while you’re staring at it</a>
            <p>An introduction to how the system keeps running and evaluating even when you are doing nothing.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="/blogs/v1b2.html">Why this isn’t a normal Photoshop or Windows-style program</a>
            <p>Explains why node-based, real-time tools behave differently from traditional document-style software.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="/blogs/v1b3.html">Nothing here is an object</a>
            <p>Reframes common object-oriented assumptions so you can think in streams and operators instead.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="/blogs/v1b4.html">What kinds of problems this thing is meant for</a>
            <p>Defines the kinds of dynamic, procedural, and interactive tasks this environment is built to solve.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="/blogs/v1b5.html">The system does not care about order</a>
            <p>Shows why execution depends on dependencies and context, not the order you built the graph.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="/blogs/v1b6.html">Time is present even when nothing changes</a>
            <p>Clarifies how time-driven evaluation exists continuously, even in networks that look visually static.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="/blogs/v1b7.html">What moves: signal flow without the myth</a>
            <p>Breaks down what actually travels through a network and what “flow” really means in practice.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="/blogs/v1b8.html">Local truth beats global intention</a>
            <p>Focuses on how each node behaves from local inputs, regardless of your broader design intent.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="/blogs/v1b9.html">The network is the program</a>
            <p>Establishes that the graph itself is the executable logic, not a hidden script elsewhere.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="/blogs/v1b10.html">What the interface is showing you</a>
            <p>Teaches you how to read panels and viewers as diagnostic tools instead of decorative UI.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="/blogs/v1b11.html">Why operators feel wrong when you meet them too early</a>
            <p>Explains why operators can seem confusing before you have the mental model to place them correctly.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="/blogs/v1b12.html">Why “Nothing Is Working” Is Usually Normal</a>
            <p>Normalizes early debugging friction and shows why temporary failure is part of learning the system.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

            <a href="/blogs/v2b2.html">How different kinds of data cross borders</a>

          <li>
            <a href="/blogs/v2b3.html">How numbers become space</a>
