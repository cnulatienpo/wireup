        <p>
          So far, everything has moved forward.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sources push. Transforms respond. Images appear. Numbers describe them.
          The flow has direction. That direction has been polite.
        </p>

        <p>
          A system begins when something is allowed to look back.
        </p>

        <p>
          Feedback is not repetition. It is influence traveling upstream.
        </p>

        <div class="do">
          <p>
            Start from a setup where an image is already affecting something else.
          </p>
          <p>
            You should have a number that came from an image, sound, or geometry.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          Right now that number probably feeds forward into another behavior.
          That is safe. Feedback is not.
        </p>

        <div class="do">
          <p>
            Find a parameter earlier in the network that could accept a number:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Noise amplitude</li>
            <li>Transform scale or rotation</li>
            <li>Level brightness</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="note">
            Pick something upstream.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          You are about to create a loop.
        </p>

        <div class="do">
          <p>
            Wire the number back into that earlier parameter.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          One of two things happens.
        </p>

        <p>
          Either the system becomes unstable immediately, or it settles into a new behavior.
          Both outcomes are correct.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is the first time the system reacts to itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          If it explodes, that is not failure. It means amplification exists.
          Something downstream is shouting back louder than the source expects.
        </p>

        <div class="do">
          <p>
            Insert one of the following anywhere in the feedback path:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>Lag</code></li>
            <li><code>Filter</code></li>
            <li><code>Math</code> (reduce the range)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          The system calms down.
        </p>

        <p>
          What you are seeing is not a trick.
          It is balance being negotiated in real time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Feedback reveals things that forward motion hides:
          sensitivity, inertia, thresholds, memory.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even without storing anything, the loop remembers.
          Its current state depends on what just happened.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is why feedback is never introduced early.
          It requires respect for scale, timing, and pressure.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once it exists, the network is no longer a chain.
          It is a conversation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many behaviors people call “alive” come from nothing more
          than a system being allowed to hear itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          If something starts to feel responsive instead of reactive,
          you are probably looking at a loop that has been given room to breathe.
