          There is no hidden script running behind the scenes.
        </p>

        <p>
          No main function waiting to be revealed. No secret order of operations that will make everything make sense once you discover it. What you see wired together is not a representation of the program. It is the program.
        </p>

        <p>
          This catches people off guard because they are used to separation. Code over here. Interface over there. Logic somewhere beneath the surface. Here, structure and behavior live in the same place.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each connection is not a step. It is a relationship that must be honored continuously. Remove it and the behavior changes immediately. Add one and the system reorganizes itself around that new obligation.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is why copying networks works better than explaining them. The explanation strips away structure. The copy preserves it. Meaning travels through shape more reliably than through description.
        </p>

        <p>
          People sometimes look for the part that does the work. The important node. The clever trick. That search misses the point. No single container carries authority. Behavior emerges from arrangement.
        </p>

        <p>
          A small change in layout can have a larger effect than a dramatic change in parameters. That is not magic. It is dependency shifting. You changed who relies on whom, and the system responded.
        </p>

        <p>
          This also explains why refactoring feels physical. You are not rewriting instructions. You are moving responsibilities around while everything keeps running. The system adapts in real time to the new shape you give it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Treating the network as documentation misses the mark. Documentation describes something else. The network does not point outward. It is self-contained. It exists to be evaluated, not read.
        </p>

        <p>
          When problems appear, they rarely live in one node. They live in the way influence travels across the whole structure. Fixing them means changing paths, not hunting for a guilty parameter.
        </p>

        <p>
          This perspective changes how effort is spent. Less time is wasted searching for the right setting. More time goes into arranging flow so the system behaves the way it should under pressure.
        </p>

        <p>
          The program is not hidden behind the network. It is spelled out in wires, dependencies, and persistence, repeating itself every frame without commentary.
